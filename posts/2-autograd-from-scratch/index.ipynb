    "In an attempt of understanding the underlying mechanism of PyTorch's autograd engine, I created its mini-version that does the same job, but on a much lower scale. This blog post explains the core ideas behind that project. This is mostly just to test my own understanding - yet again. But if you gain any knowledge from this, I'd be glad. Let's get started!"
