This blog post explains the core ideas behind that project. This is mostly just to test my own understanding - yet again. Hopefully, by the end of this post, you will have a better understanding of Autograd and how to implement a simple autograd engine from scratch. This post assumes that you have a basic familiarity with Python and a little bit of Calculus."

    "text": "Contextualizing the Problem\nIn order to understand the need of an Autograd engine, we will first need to understand what makes its existence relevant in the first place. Although it is commonly associated with Neural Networks - which is the only case we are concerned with really, it is actually a completely independent concept that has nothing to do with Neural Networks. It is the idea of computing derivatives of some variable with reference to all the variables that were used to result in that value.\nIf that didnâ€™t make any sense to you, donâ€™t worry about it. Stick with me, and Iâ€™ll explain using visualizations and code.\n\nNumPy vs.Â PyTorch\nOther things that separate the two:\n\nParallel runtime & GPU usage\nData type restriction\nWhat is a tensor, tensor vs.Â Array\n\nThe main one that weâ€™re concerned with:\n\nAutomatic Differentiation Engine\n\n\n\nReferences"
