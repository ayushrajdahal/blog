    "text": "In an attempt of understanding the underlying mechanism of PyTorch’s autograd engine, I created its mini-version that does the same job, but on a much lower scale. This blog post explains the core ideas behind that project. This is mostly just to test my own understanding - yet again. Hopefully, by the end of this post, you will have a better understanding of to implement a simple autograd engine. This post assumes that you have a basic familiarity with Python and a little bit of Calculus."
